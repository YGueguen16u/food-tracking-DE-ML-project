# Data Engineering project : Tracking food habits of users

In this project, I created fake users categorized by their food habits 
(meat lover, vegetarian, etc.) and developed an API that generates 
fake consumption data for each user based on their eating profile.

The data are generated by an API (sensor_api) that I deployed on Render, 
which produces real-time data.

After extracting the data from the API, I transform it to make it usable 
for further analysis (such as habit analysis, predictions, and 
content-based filtering). 

I also applied some DevOps skills to ensure code quality and results, 
with the goal of integrating 
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)processes.
