# Data Engineering project : Tracking food habits of users

In this project, I created fake users categorized by their food habits 
(meat lover, vegetarian, etc.) and developed an API that generates 
fake consumption data for each user based on their eating profile.

The data are generated by an API (sensor_api) that I deployed on Render, 
which produces real-time data.
